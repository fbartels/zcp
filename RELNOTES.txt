Release notes for 7.2.3
=======================

Enhancements:
* Avoid compression on all kinds of localhost connections
* dagent: better error reporting on duplicate email addresses
* dagent can log rules processed for a user (at "debug" log_level)
* pyza: add basic search API
* preview for Amazon S3 storage backend for attachments

Fixes:
* record all mail references so that MUAs show threading (ZCP-11358)
* backup-plus: deal with special characters in user names
* do not stop LDAP entry retrieval after one page (1000 entries)
* avoid crash when Search Index has truncated ENTRYIDs

Changes:
* gateway: non-SSL plaintext authentication is offered if connection
  originates from localhost
* the "fatal" log level is now called "crit" (for critical),
  since in the fewest case were the reported conditions actually
  fatal (= program-terminating). This may be relevant if you do
  automated log analysis.


Release notes for 7.2.2
=======================

Enhancements:

* Within systemd environments, if you want to make (best) use of
  journald, "log_file" should be set to "syslog" rather than "-"
  (stderr).

* IPv6 support in zarafa-server and zarafa-ws.
  To enable, the "server_bind" parameter in the respective
  configuration file needs to be set to an IPv6 address. Use of the
  so-called IPv6 Unspecified Address, ::, makes the service reachable
  on both IPv6 and IPv4 on all addresses.

* IPv6 support in all other daemons.
  To enable, the "server_bind" parameter in the respective
  configuration file must be empty, or be commented out, or (if only
  IPv6 service is desired) be assigned an IPv6 address.

* IPv6 support in connecting clients

* backup-plus: technology preview for a new implementation of a
  backup utility

* Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman Exchange (ECDHE) support for TLS
* dagent: new "mr_autoprocess" parameter available for dagent.cfg
* dagent: allow empty Out Of Office bodies and improve reporting
  in case no mail is sent
* dagent/spooler: add anti-loop headers for Exchange and Vacation
* python: support UTF-8 in .vcf files
* zarafa-set-oof gained the --dump-json option
* mapi4linux: connecting to the default server socket location is
  possible by passing NULL/"" as the target path to HrOpenECSession.

Fixes:

* inetmapi: The MAPI to Internet Email translator avoids emitting
  mails for invalid addresses (e.g. no '@' in it). This way, spooler
  won't spam the SMTP server with unhandlable mails.
* dagent: avoid crash/hang on shutdown
* dagent: retain attachment status for top-level part
* gateway: improved IMAP RFC conformance
* gateway: ZARAFA-type addresses are now resolved to SMTP type before
  being emitted over IMAP
* ldapplugin: avoid crash when bad server URI is configured
* presence: do not report failure on proper shutdown

Changes:

* Most daemons are now started using an unprivileged user. Be sure that
  "run_as_user" and "run_as_group" are commented out to use the default,
  "zarafa". If using our prebuilt DEB/RPM packages, this user and group
  will be created on installation (if not already present).

* If you use PAM authentication with /etc/shadow, be aware that the
  server needs to run as a user/group able to read it.

* Permissions on directories like /var/lib/zarafa/* may need to be
  adjusted, especially if you use custom locations. We chose not to
  automatically recurisvely chown all of them, because it can
  potentially take a long time and be incorrect.

* To facilitate use of IPv6 on a single socket, zarafa-dagent no longer
  binds to the IPv4-only 127.0.0.1 by default. It is advised to review
  your firewall settings and perhaps block port 2003 if applicable.

* Default AF_LOCAL socket locations have changed to /var/run/zarafad.
  Review your /etc/zarafa/*.cfg for the value after installation that
  they are consistent. _Also_ check the LDAP tree (if applicable) for
  the zarafaFilePath attribute of objects which may also carry the
  socket location.

* Default PID file locations have changed to /var/run/zarafad.
  Check for duplicate programs running on non-systemd services.

* Several fixes to character set recognition. The MIME RFCs are
  pretty clear on where the declarations of charset can be found
  (ZCP looked elsewhere), what characters are allowed where, and
  how MIME parts are to be parsed.

* calendar: disregard timezones for all-day events so that they
  always start and end at 00:00.
* gateway: tone down log level for successful logins
* server: improved reporting in case all file descriptors are used up
* server: raise default cache size from 16 to 32 megabytes
* Corrected improper "fatal" severity level for some more messages

Notes:

* Files in /var/run/zarafad may continue to be owned by root -
  this is a normal condition even if you set run_as_user/group to something.

* The "server_bind" parameter was previously, and continues to be, documented
  to require an address, not a hostname. This is now enforced with new use of
  getaddrinfo(3).
