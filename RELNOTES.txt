Release notes for 7.2.2
=======================

Enhancements:

* Within systemd environments, if you want to make (best) use of
  journald, "log_file" should be set to "syslog" rather than "-"
  (stderr).

* IPv6 support in zarafa-server and zarafa-ws.
  To enable, the "server_bind" parameter in the respective
  configuration file needs to be set to an IPv6 address. Use of the
  so-called IPv6 Unspecified Address, ::, makes the service reachable
  on both IPv6 and IPv4 on all addresses.

* IPv6 support in all other daemons.
  To enable, the "server_bind" parameter in the respective
  configuration file must be empty, or be commented out, or (if only
  IPv6 service is desired) be assigned an IPv6 address.

* IPv6 support in connecting clients
* dagent: new "mr_autoprocess" parameter available for dagent.cfg
* python: support UTF-8 in .vcf files

Fixes:

* inetmapi: The MAPI to Internet Email translator avoids emitting
  mails for invalid addresses (e.g. no '@' in it). This way, spooler
  won't spam the SMTP server with unhandlable mails.

Changes:

* Most daemons are now started using an unprivileged user. Be sure that
  "run_as_user" and "run_as_group" are commented out to use the default,
  "zarafa". If using our prebuilt DEB/RPM packages, this user and group
  will be created on installation (if not already present).

* Permissions on directories may need to be adjusted. If using our
  prebuild DEB/RPM packages, the owner of /var/lib/zarafa and
  /var/log/zarafa will be changed on package installation. Any custom
  locations in use need to be manually adjusted.

* To facilitate use of IPv6 on a single socket, zarafa-dagent no longer
  binds to the IPv4-only 127.0.0.1 by default. It is advised to review
  your firewall settings and perhaps block port 2003 if applicable.

* Default AF_LOCAL socket locations have changed to /var/run/zarafad.
  Review your /etc/zarafa/*.cfg for the value after installation that
  they are consistent. _Also_ check the LDAP tree (if applicable) for
  the zarafaFilePath attribute of objects which may also carry the
  socket location.

* Default PID file locations have changed to /var/run/zarafad.
  Check for duplicate programs running on non-systemd services.

* Several fixes to character set recognition. The MIME RFCs are
  pretty clear on where the declarations of charset can be found
  (ZCP looked elsewhere), what characters are allowed where, and
  how MIME parts are to be parsed.

* calendar: disregard timezones for all-day events so that they
  always start and end at 00:00.
* server: improved reporting in case all file descriptors are used up
* Corrected improper "fatal" severity level for some more messages

Notes:

* Files in /var/run/zarafad may still be owned by root - this is normal.

* The "server_bind" parameter was previously, and continues to be, documented
  to require an address, not a hostname. This is now enforced with new use of
  getaddrinfo(3).
