// Interface for writing and reading properties to disk (which does the actual transfer and save)
// 
// Strategy is to load most of the small (ie not much data) properties at load-time. This saves
// a lot of overhead if the properties were to be acquired one-by-one over the network. However, a
// complete list of properties is also read through HrReadProps(), so the local system also knows
// about larger properties. These properties are read through HrLoadProp().
//
// When a save is done, only the *changes* to the properties are propagated, by using HrDeleteProps
// and HrWriteProps. HrWriteProps changes and/or adds any new or modified properties, while HrDeleteProps
// removes any properties that have been completely removed.
//
// This keeps the overall performance high, by having relatively low latency problems as most message 
// accesses will be kept down to about 1 to 5 network accesses, and have low bandwidth requirements as
// large data is only loaded on demand.
