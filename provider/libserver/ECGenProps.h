 * This class is a general serverside class for generated properties. A Generated
 * property is any property that cannot be directly stored or read from the database.
 * This means properties like PR_ENTRYID because they are not stored as a property, 
 * properties like PR_NORMALIZED_SUBJECT because they are computed from the PR_SUBJECT,
 * and PR_MAPPING_SIGNATURE because they are stored elsewhere within the database.
 *
 * The client can also generate some properties, but only if these are fixed properties
 * that don't have any storage on the server, and they are also properties that are
 * never sorted on in tables. (due to the server actually doing the sorting)
