/**
 * We are adding a bit of functionality to vmime::message here for S/MIME support.
 *
 * MAPI provides us with the actual body of a signed S/MIME message that looks like
 *
 * -----------------------
 * Content-Type: xxxx
 *
 * data
 * data
 * data
 * ...
 * -----------------------
 *
 * This class works just like a vmime::message instance, except that when then 'SMIMEBody' is set, it will
 * use that body (including some headers!) to generate the RFC822 message. All other methods are inherited
 * directly from vmime::message.
 *
 * Note that any other body data set will be override by the SMIMEBody.
