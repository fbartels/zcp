/**
 * This class can be used to output a tabbar control
 *
 * HOWTO BUILD:
 * - $tabs = array("general" => ("General"), "appointment" => _("Appointment")); //initialize your tab's
 * - $tabbar = new TabBar($tabs, key($tabs));
 * HOWTO USE:
 * - $tabbar->createTabs();        //this is the point where you like to place the tabbar
 * - $tabbar->beginTab("general"); //create the tab  
 * - //insert your code (php, html or javascript)
 * - $tabbar->endTab();            //close the tab 
 * DEPENDS ON:
 * |------> tabbar.js
 * |------> tabbar.css

   * @param mixed  $selected If this is a string, then the tab with this 'id' is marked selected, if this is an array, then it assumes that every entry must be marked selected
   * @param string $id       This is the id for the tabbar itself (for use in CSS) default is 'tabbar'

   * $tabs = array('tab1'=>'Home','tab2'=>'Test');
   * Now we have 2 tabs, 'tab1' is the id for the element that contains the 'Home' tab etc. The name of the tabbutton will be 'tab_tab1'
   *
   * NOTE: please remember that when you use more then 1 tabbar on a page you must use different id's, also note that some modifications are needed in the CSS
