	Queue Plug-in
	
	Features:
		*Adds a cancelQueue() method for cancelling the entire queue.
		*All queued files are uploaded when startUpload() is called.
		*If false is returned from uploadComplete then the queue upload is stopped.
		 If false is not returned (strict comparison) then the queue upload is continued.
		*Adds a QueueComplete event that is fired when all the queued files have finished uploading.
		 Set the event handler with the queue_complete_handler setting.
